Unsorted Block Images (UBI) is a volume manager for raw flash, ported from
Linux to Zephyr. Raw flash is erased only in whole blocks, each block wears out
after a limited number of erases, and a power cut can leave an update half
done. UBI splits one flash partition into named volumes and stores their
logical blocks in physical erase blocks in any order, hence *unsorted*. Moving
blocks freely lets it spread erases evenly, replace a block atomically and
take failing blocks out of use. Its own metadata is authenticated with
AES-CMAC.

## Features

- **Named volumes** — created, resized and removed at run time.
- **Atomic block updates** — `ubi_leb_change()` replaces a logical block
  whole: after a power cut, it holds the old contents or the new.
- **Appends** — `ubi_leb_write_at()` adds data to a logical block without an
  erase.
- **Power-cut safety** — volume changes, erases and maintenance steps survive
  a power cut at any point.
- **Wear levelling** — erases are spread over the whole partition, and data
  that does not change is moved so that its block wears too.
- **Bad block handling** — a block that fails a write is taken out of use
  until the next attach; a failed erase makes the device read-only.
- **Authenticated metadata** — block headers and the volume table carry an
  AES-CMAC under a key derived from a PSA Crypto key; damage and tampering are
  reported apart. `CONFIG_UBI_VERIFY_ON_READ` checks the block header again on
  every read.
- **Rollback detection** — a state callback decides whether to trust the
  device, at every attach and every `CONFIG_UBI_STATE_CHECK_INTERVAL` writes.
- **Maintenance on demand** — erasing and wear levelling run in
  `ubi_maintenance()`, on a budget the application chooses; no background
  thread.

Application data is stored as given: neither encrypted nor authenticated.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Zephyr | 4.4 |
| Cryptography | PSA Crypto with AES-CMAC, HKDF and SHA-256 (mbedTLS, TF-M or the platform's own) |
| Partition | one fixed partition of 4 to 65534 erase blocks of one size |
| Erase block | larger than the two 64-byte headers and the volume table (320 bytes with 4 volumes) |
| Write block | divides 64 bytes |
| Programming | every write block once after an erase, in any order |
| RAM | a fixed-size handle; on the heap, a scratch buffer and 8 bytes per erase block |
| Stack | under 2 KiB for any call |
